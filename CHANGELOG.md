## [0.5.0] - 2025-03-14  
### Added  
- **File Watcher with Caching**: Implemented a file watcher that monitors API files for changes, reducing the need for full rescans. Includes a caching system for efficient route storage.  
- **Automated File Retrieval for Frameworks**: Introduced a utility to streamline file collection based on framework-specific structures.  

### Changed  
- **Improved File Filtering and Directory Handling**: Refactored file retrieval logic to enhance directory and file filtering, now processing directories in batches to prevent stack overflows.  
- **Updated Welcome Message**: The welcome message now encourages users to report unsupported frameworks to a newly added GitHub issue template.   

## [0.4.1] - 2025-03-10  
### Changed

## [0.4.0] - 2025-03-05
### Added
- **Enhanced FastAPI Processing**: Improved FastAPI route processing to handle router prefixes and include them in the basepath, ensuring accurate detection of API routes.
- **Postman Export Command**: Added a command that exports API routes as an importable Postman JSON collection, including method, full path, and path parameters.

### Fixed
- **Koa Route Extraction**: Corrected method detection and prefix handling in Koa to prevent database calls from being mistaken as route definitions.
- **Copy Button Bug**: Fixed an issue where the copy button would disappear after being clicked.
