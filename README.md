- **Optimized File Scanning**: Improved performance by scanning only relevant files, reducing unnecessary processing.

### v0.5.1 - 2025-03-15 
- Fixed infinite loading when no routes were detected.  
- Resolved an issue where configuration changes weren't applying properly.  

### v0.5.0 - 2025-03-14  
- **File Watcher with Caching** – OctAPI now detects file changes and updates routes automatically, significantly improving performance.  
- **Automated File Retrieval for Frameworks** – A new utility streamlines file collection based on framework-specific structures, enhancing compatibility.
